# List of instances, each being a dictionary.
# Any option listed in [Trident's reference](https://netapp-trident.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docker/install/index.html) added here.

# In addition, the following is mandatory:
# - alias: alias used to installed the plugin.
# - version: plugin version to install. Note that the "official" option `version` refers to the config file version number (always equal to "1" and injected by the role) and is different from the meaning in the playbook.

# Example:
# trident_instances:
#   - alias: netapp
#     version: latest
#     username: admin

trident_instances: []

# A default list of options
# At a minimum, the following plugin options need to be defined here or directly in the instance.
